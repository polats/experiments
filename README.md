# Parse-dashboard example

Example project using the [parse-dashboard](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) module with Express. Read the full [guide](https://hyperdev.com/blog/use-parse-server-apps-backend-hyperdev/)

If you don't have one already, you'll need to setup a [Parse Server first](https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/iridescent-ripper)

Then, to get started set the following values in .env:

- Provide a value for MASTER_KEY - this should match the MASTER_KEY you set for your server

- Set the SERVER_URL. If it's on HyperDev too it'll have the format: https://project-name.hyperdev.space/parse

- Make up a value for APP_NAME - This is a name for your app that is used on the dashboard

- USER_NAME and PASSWORD - Specify a username/password you'll use to log in to the dashboard
Then click 'Show'!
